My name is Åžermin and I am an English teacher at TAFE Queensland living in Brisbane, Australia. I have been teaching English since 2014. Even though my background is in science, studying TESOL at the University of Amsterdam and English Language and Linguistics at the University of Brighton is what changed my career path.

I am a native speaker of three languages (i.e., Dutch, Turkish, and English), I have been able to speak these languages throughout my life and worked hard to maintain them. I learned French and German in high school but did not have the passion or a reason to continue using those languages, so have lost the ability to speak them over the years. However, I still understand and can read in German as this language is closely related to Dutch. As an adult, I tried to learn Spanish, which made me understand the difficulties of learning a language at a later stage in life. 

Studying English Language, Linguistics, TESOL, and Applied Linguistics made me understand not only how to be a versatile teacher, but provided a better understanding of the different types of learners. 
Working at international language institutions where students from all over the world come together, allowed me to, metaphorically speaking, teach the world on a micro-scale. These experiences have helped learners on a global scale, become better language users based on their individual needs.

Each student has different learning needs. Assessing those needs and creating a personalised learning plan will help them to improve the skills they struggle with most. In order to improve, learners have to recognise their errors, because self-correction is a way to measure progress.

I work full-time as an English teacher, but I also provide support to people online because I am passionate about working with and helping people to achieve their dreams.  I do not see my job as work but as pure enjoyment, because learning languages is fun, interesting, and challenging. The languages we speak can create understanding across cultures, which is what brings people together.
